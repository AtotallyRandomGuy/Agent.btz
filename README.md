# Agent.btz
Agent.btz MALWARE BINARY

mimics some other mals out there like fanny.bmp, and flame, etc.


Agent.BTZ, also named Autorun,[1][2] is a computer worm that infects USB flash drives with spyware. A variant of the SillyFDC worm,[3] it was used in a massive 2008 cyberattack on the US military. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent.BTZ

Note: the samples are dangerous. Use at your own risk.


### Some of these (like fanny, and of course stuxnet, among many others) are avail. Online, but I chose to upload those who I couldn't find. (and still realyl cant)
Saying this as I did on fanny.bmp, if someone do indeed **have more / same samples** any contribution is welcomed!


Feel free to open any issue/for discussion/comments - questions or additional details.

As I said in the video, my laptop did nearly die, so it wasn't the "Best" poc video. But hopefully it's good enough.
